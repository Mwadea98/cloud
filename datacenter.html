					<h1 class="mb-3">The Data Center</h1>
					<p>An on-premises data center is a server, or a collection of servers, that you purchase and keep on site to serve your data storage needs. Some people see this as a disadvantage; you have to purchase the server hardware along with networking hardware. Like any technology, it will age and need to be replaced. Along with the cost of purchasing all of this equipment, you will also need to hire a staff to configure, customize, manage, maintain, and secure it all. These staff members need to be highly trained and keep their skills up to date. </p>

					<p>Finally, some people see this model as limited when it comes to scalability. Sure, you can always buy more hardware, but it takes time to bring additional servers online, and that time lost may affect your business.</p>

					<p>Reliance on a data center is not all bad; there are a number of advantages to this model. For one, you have complete control over your data and equipment. No one, other than the people you allow, will have access. Because you own the equipment, you also control exactly what hardware and software you are using, making customizations much easier because you don’t need permission from a vendor. Finally, if you are running any legacy systems, you can set up an environment that will cater to these solutions. This gives you flexibility when it comes to migrating to a newer system on your own terms.</p>

					<h1 class="mt-3 mb-3">The Cloud</h1>
					<p>In a cloud-based solution, you store your data on someone else’s hardware and infrastructure. Many people are concerned about the idea of giving up so much control. Even though employees at reputable cloud hosting vendors undergo background checks, some companies just aren’t comfortable with someone else handling and possibly accessing their data.</p>
					<p>Security is also a concern with the cloud-based option. Even though your vendor is storing your data, you are still ultimately responsible for protecting it. If data is compromised, you will be the one who winds up paying the price. There are companies that feel that if they are going to be responsible, then they are going to be the ones to take on the responsibility of security. Additionally, there is the issue of accessibility. If your internet connection goes down, you can’t access your remote data stores, and for some, that can be a big problem.</p>
					<p>Ironically, security is also seen as an advantage of cloud-based hosts. Reputable vendors hire highly trained, experienced staff members to make sure that everything is configured properly, constantly maintained, and adequately secured. </p>

					<h1 class="mt-5">Myths</h1>
					<h3>The cloud is not secure.</h3>
					<p>This is one of the most pervasive myths surrounding the cloud and was one of the biggest obstacles during the early days of cloud adoption. People assumed (incorrectly) that because data or services were moved to the cloud, the cloud was less secure because other people would have access to it. Nowadays, most people realize that this isn’t usually accurate.</p>

					<p>Most cloud providers actually do a better job than data centers when it comes to security because they have experts who handle the security, management, and maintenance of the servers and infrastructure used.</p>
					<h2>Data centers are too expensive to operate.</h2>
					<p>The cloud has the ability to be cheaper and can work better, but this isn’t always the case. You won’t always get the same level of service from one vendor that you would from another. Additionally, costs for using cloud services fluctuate based on time of day, usage, and other variables. So although moving to the cloud is cost-effective for some businesses, others may rack up unnecessary costs—especially if a migration to the cloud is not planned properly or if they require a large amount of bandwidth.</p>
